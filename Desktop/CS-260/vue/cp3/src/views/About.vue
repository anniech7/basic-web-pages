    I've worn these rings since I was 12 years old. Since I was little I
    noticed how effortlessly and naturally rings elevated a person's
    appearance and style. It was almost like an expression of someones
    personality and I thought that was cool. When I was like 12 years old a
    family friend, Christian Beckham (you have to understand he was my HERO)
    had a spoon ring. I wanted one so my dad(who is very handy) helped
    me set up some random tools in the garage to make one. I made these for
    myself and a very select few for my closest friends throughout junior
    high and high school. People would ask where I got them and if i sold
    them but I wasn't really interested. It sounded like a big leap and
    scary and it was something that was just for ME. I liked that it was
    special and unique to who I was. Only I had these rings because
    I MADE THEM.

    A good 7 YEARS after wearing my rings I had a week where
    3 strangers (in person) asked where I got them and that same week
    there was a comment on my instagram "SOMEONE HELP A GIRL OUT and tell
    me where Tristen’s gets his rings from because they’re BOMB. pls"
    I decided I'd just do it and sell some for the people who wanted them
    and that'd be it. They sold that night. and here we are more than
    a year later the rest is history. But I think the reason people
    respond to it so well is because it's something that's always been me.
    It's authentic, it's a passion, it's who I am, it's a story, it's a
    deeper meaning, it's something I've taken to who knows how many
    countries, it's a lifestyle, it's just me.
